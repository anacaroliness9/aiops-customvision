# Custom Vision Operations

***Applying Devops to Custom Vision Project***

In this workshop you will learn how to create a Custom Vision project with code (Python), how to get the evaluation metrics from your Custom Vision trained model with the Custom Vision SDK and sckit-learn, how to deploy, how to send alerts with your model do not perform well and how use the good predictions to re-feed your model re-train your model to continuously improve it. All this applying Devops.
